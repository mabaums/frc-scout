# FRC Scouting Web App

This project is not yet ready for public usage! 
At the moment the readme is more of running notes, 
and will become something more useful as the project matures

## Prerequisites
This application is using the following technology stacks
* Angular 6 on the front end
* Python and Flask on the backend
You should install those in your environment.

## Running in Debug
This will change as implementation gets containerized
### Running Backend
1) Navigate to the `backend` directory 
2) Set a couple of environment variables:
`export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development`
3) Start the server by running command `flask run`

### Running Front End
1) Navigate to the `frontend` directory 
2) Run `ng serve -o` command
